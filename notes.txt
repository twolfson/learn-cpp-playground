## Informational links
- https://www.cplusplus.com/info/description/
    - Good overview of language types, nothing new for me =/
- https://www.cplusplus.com/info/history/
    - Skimmed, nice history on C++
- https://www.cplusplus.com/info/faq/
    - Good clarifications on a few things
    - Including that ANSI-C++ is a standard, whereas iirc there's inconsistencies between compilers so we have to wrangle with defined vs undefined behavior

## Tutorial

Assembly...

How compilation works...

Console programs...

Due to being on Linux, we'll use `g++`
Clang is good for OS X

- Code comments
- `#` is a directive symbol
    - `#include` means to insert the code into this file (kind of like PHP `include`)
        - As opposed to Python and Node.js `import`/`require` which load that part of the program as a module which can be referenced but isn't in the same file per-se
    - `#include <iostream>` means include the *header* for iostream (still need to fully understand what a header is...)
- `int main ()` - Declare a function which returns an `int`, is called `main`, and takes 0 parameters
    - `main` is special as it's what's called when the program is run
    - Not mentioned: `int` is going to be the exit code of the program
        - If not specified, then the function will return `0` by default (success exit code)
- `std::cout` - `std` is standard, `cout` is character output
- `<<` is insertion operator so we insert the string to `std::cout`
