# learn-cpp-playground
A playground environment to learn and explore C++

## Process to date
- Read through [cplusplus.com's tutorial](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/) and took notes in
  - Folders 00-19 are based on this
- Played around with [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) to get some "oh, I wouldn't have thought of that" moments
- Tentative: Play around with data structures and design patterns to figure out C++ nuances (e.g. garbage collection, testing, syntax)
